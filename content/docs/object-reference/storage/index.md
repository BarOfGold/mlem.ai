# Storage extensions

Storage extensions add support for new types of location that MLEM can use to
store artifacts in [`save` API method](/doc/api-reference/save)

Typicaly they will implement [Storage](/doc/user-guide/mlem-abcs#storage) and
[Artifact](/doc/user-guide/mlem-abcs#artifact) interfaces.
