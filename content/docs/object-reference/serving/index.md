# Serving extensions

Serving extensions add new types of servers to use with `serve`
[API](/doc/api-reference/serve) and [CLI](/doc/command-reference/serve) commands

Typicaly they will implement [Server](/doc/object-reference/mlem-abcs#builder) and
[Client](/doc/object-reference/mlem-abcs#client) interfaces
